              Welcome to CleanX — where car care meets next-level convenience.
              We’re not just washing cars — we’re redefining how people care for
              their vehicles. With CleanX, you get professional, eco-friendly
              car washes and luxury spa treatments delivered straight to your
              doorstep, all on a simple monthly subscription that costs less
              than your weekly coffee habit. ☕🚗 Why CleanX? At CleanX, we
              believe that every car deserves premium care, no matter if you
              drive a hatchback, SUV, or a head-turning supercar. Our services
              are designed for busy people who want to keep their ride spotless
              without wasting time at wash centers or doing it themselves.
